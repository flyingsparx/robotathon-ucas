# Running the lab session

This file contains instructions on setting up and running the lab session for visit days.

## Setting up the lab

1. Over the days before the session, speak to the School's System Managers and ask them to generate a set of temporary Novell accounts for use in the Windows lab. You may need to know how many applicants are expected on the visit day so that they know how many to generate.
1. On the visit day, allow about 45 minutes before the scheduled start time to set up the lab.
1. Login each required machine with the generated usernames. Logging in can take a while, so it's usually best to continue logging them all in without waiting for each one to finish.
1. On each logged-in machine, open Google Chrome and Sublime Text.
1. Visit the app's URL (http://ucas.openday.cs.cf.ac.uk) on each machine using Chrome and minimise the window.
1. Ensure Sublime is open with a blank document.
1. Ask Laurence (or otherwise) get a remote control for the lab's projector(s) and ensure you can present using these properly.

## Running the lab

1. As the visitors enter, ask them to sit by a computer that is logged-in and ready. If there are many of them, then some might have to sit in pairs.
1. Introduce yourself and explain the scope of the session.
1. Go through the slides of the presentation, explaining clearly the key concepts. Some visitors will have programmed before (possibly in Python) - others will not have done any before at all, so bear this in mind.
1. Whilst going through the slides, demo the webapp at suitable points and ask the applicants to have a go by copying some example code from the slides and testing it by uploading it to the app.
1. Continue through the rest of the slides (try not to use more than 10-15 minutes or so).
1. Afterwards, let the applicants have more of a free-reign over their robot AIs and encourage them to try new things, upload the bots, and test/battle them against each other.
1. Encourage the student helpers to get involved with helping out the applicants.


## A few points to note

* If the robot test fails, it's usually due to a Python error (indentation).
* If the robot test passes but robots don't move when they should, it's due to some wrong code in the `act()` method
